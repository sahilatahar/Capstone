![Yhills-Capstone](https://github.com/sahilatahar/Yhills-Capstone/assets/100127570/2f0ce665-9a49-42a8-be54-c0f875905486)

Similar to the Yhills site, Capston is a web-based platform created to give pupils tutorials in the form of videos or prose. This initiative, which was created as a part of the **Yhills internship** programme, intends to provide thorough study resources for numerous courses. Popular YouTube channels such as CodeWithHarry, ApnaCollege, freeCodeCamp, and others offer video tutorials that students can access. Students may also use local storage on the platform to keep track of their course information and personal data.

## Features
- **Video Tutorials:** Capston offers a range of video tutorials covering different courses. Users can access tutorials on programming languages, and other technology topics. The videos are carefully curated to ensure high-quality content and a comprehensive learning experience.
- **YouTube Channel Attribution:** For the videos utilised in the tutorials, the platform offers credit to YouTube channels such as CodeWithHarry, ApnaCollege, freeCodeCamp, and others. We value the worthwhile content that these channels produce.
- **Local Storage:** Capston has a function for storing student information, such as the courses they've taken, contact information, and other pertinent information. This makes it simple for students to monitor their progress and keep a record of their academic career.
- **Responsive Design:** The adaptable design of Capston makes it possible for users to visit the website and watch tutorials on a variety of devices, including PCs, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **Dark Mode:** The dark mode function in Capston enables users to change to a darker colour scheme for lessened eye strain and improved readability in low-light conditions.
